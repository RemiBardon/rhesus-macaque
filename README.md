# Rhesus Macaque üêí

Lightweight tool helping internationalization of [Hugo] websites.
It uses LLMs (currently OpenAI GPTs) to translate content files
while keeping meaningful data intact such as [shortcodes] names and [Orangutan] profiles.

<!-- Design decisions are detailed in [`design/README.md`](./design/README.md). -->

## Main features ‚ú®

- **Translates** whole Hugo content pages ([front matter] included)
- Translates **automatically** using [OpenAI API]
- Supports **all languages** supported by OpenAI GPTs
- Makes sure the website **still generates successfully**
- **Labels pages** as "Generated by an AI"
- Allows **manual overrides**
- Takes care of putting **foreign words in italics**

Saves money by:

- **Avoiding re-translation** of the same content pages twice (if it hasn't changed)
- Allowing **manual translation** (without [OpenAI API] token)
- Only translating pages **with [`translationKey`] defined**
- **Skipping [draft]** pages

Also worth mentioning:

- Works with [Orangutan] (as it doesn't break profile names)

## Why this name? ü§®

> Which primate (except the Human) can be found in the most countries in the world?

> The Rhesus Macaque (Macaca mulatta) is one of the most widely distributed non-human primates in the world after humans. They are native to South, Central, and Southeast Asia, and have been introduced to various other regions, often due to human activities such as the pet trade or scientific research. Rhesus macaques can be found in several countries across Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and even parts of Europe, making them one of the most geographically widespread primate species apart from humans.
